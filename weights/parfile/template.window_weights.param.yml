# category weighting
category_weighting:
  flag: True
  # remember, we define the ratio as number of windows
  # in one category. So for shorter period bands, it is
  # supposed to have larger values because of more
  # windows. However, in weightin, it means samller
  # weights since the weight ~ 1/N_{windows}
